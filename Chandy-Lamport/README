FILES:
ChandyLamport.java:     Has the main method. Reads the config file name from command line and calls the start() method of Setup class.
Setup.java :            Sets up connections to send and receive messages from the node's neighbours and then initiates FloodProtocol, MAP and CL protocol.
MesgRecvThread.java:    Create a RecvThread for each incoming channel
RecvThread.java:        For a given incoming channel, calls methods for operating on messages received based on message type.
MAPSendThread.java:     Runs MAP by choosing a neighbour at random and sending a MAP message
FloodProtocol.java:     Node 0 floods the network by which all non-zero nodes choose a parent that can forward their local states to node 0 later.
CLPThread.java:         Node 0 initiates CL protocol and captures snapshots, while other nodes end markers to outgoing channels and local states to node 0.
LocalState.java:        Structure for storing local state
Params.java:            Structure for passing configuration parameters.
Message.java:           Message class for different types of messages and to convert to/from byte buffers.
